# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, was a company that wanted to help students practice to take their driving tests both written and on the road. They wanted a web application running on the cloud.

# What did you do particularly well?
Figuring out the requirements of the client/system based on what they said they wanted. This includes both technical and functional requirements. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe the diagrams would need to be revised and some of the requirements. As more information is figured out these need to reflect the new information. I would go into a little more detail on the diagrams and the requirements.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I listened to what the client said they needed and then thought from the point of view of the user. I interpreted that into what was needed vs wanted. I implemented the needs into the requirements for the system. It is important to consider the user's needs because that is who will be using the system. If their needs are not met, they may choose to not use the system and that means the client will not make money.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I look at the process as a puzzle, there is a big picture but also within this is each individual piece. I would ask for other people to take a look and think of what might they would need as a user. Having only one set of eyes on something limits the view and adding other views can add insight into a system.
